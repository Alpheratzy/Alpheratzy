Hi! My name is Alexandra and IÂ´m a new developer. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  about  HTML, JS, CSS and REACT, in a regional Bootcamp called Laboratoria,  with other girls from all over Latin America. 

âš¡ Fun fact: Before I started programming,I was always in the field of the arts, so my approach to the world of programming is in line with the beauty and functionality of the web applications I create.  The user must enjoy using them. That's my personal philosophy.
